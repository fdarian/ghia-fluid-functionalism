/**
 * Calls `callback(dt, now)` about every 16 ms, with `dt` the ms since the last
 * frame. Loops gpuix can run natively (a motion value's `animate`, `repeat`,
 * CSS keyframes) stay off it. Two still use it: the fluid-hover lists demo,
 * which re-measures its rows each frame while a sub-menu's spring settles (at
 * most `TRACK_MS`); and the cost meter, which reads this clock's gaps as its
 * stall probe. The
 * timer runs only while something is subscribed and shown, and a subscription
 * ends with the owner that made it. A subscriber inside a culled region
 * (`OnScreenContext`) is skipped while that region is far: every signal a
 * hidden loop sets would still redraw the window. It resumes as after a stall,
 * with the next `dt` counting from the resume. A stalled frame is skipped for
 * everyone rather than delivered as one huge `dt`. Returns a function that ends
 * the subscription early.
