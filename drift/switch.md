# switch

Original: `registry/base/switch.tsx`, demo in `app/docs/switch/page.tsx` of the source
(fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/switch.tsx`,
demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/switch.tsx`.

One entry per place the port looks or behaves differently from the source, whatever the cause. Shared gpuix gaps
(selector `:has(.x)` and group-has) get a one-line entry here that links to the README row instead of
repeating it.

## Focus ring gap is not filled with the background

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated; `focusRing()` is the shared outline helper).
- **Original:** `focus-visible:ring-1 ring-[color:var(--focus-ring)] ring-offset-2 ring-offset-background` (`switch.tsx:291`): the 2px gap between track and ring is painted in the page background.
- **Port:** a 1px outline at offset 2 (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/switch.tsx:173`, `focusRing` at `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/theme.ts:562`); the gap shows whatever is behind the switch. On the demo card (surface 2) that is a hair lighter than the source's page background.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (position and colour exact, the gap tint differs on non-page surfaces).
- **Components it hits:** every port of a `ring-offset-background` ring.

## A drag starts from the thumb's resting target, not its live position

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. The thumb's x is a motion value now (`thumbX`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/switch.tsx:105`), so `restX: () => thumbX.get()` would read where it is. It was tried and left out: the primitive reads `restX` after the press shape applies, the source reads x before it, so the pressed-shape origin (12 checked) and the live one (14 at rest) end `check-switch`'s drag of 6px from the track centre on opposite sides of the midpoint, and this slice keeps the drag outcomes as they were.
- **Original:** `originX: motionX.get()` (`switch.tsx:143-148`), so a press during a spring picks the thumb up where it is.
- **Port:** `originX: restX()` (`base-ui:src/switch/thumb/switch-thumb.ts:37`, fed by `restX` at `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/switch.tsx:83-86`), the pressed-shape target. A press that starts dragging while the thumb is still springing makes it jump to that target on the first drag frame. Visible only when pressing during a spring.
- **Workaround:** none. Listed in `base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md` (Switch, "Drag starts from where the thumb is now").
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Props not ported: `thumbTransition`, `className`, `ref`, HTML attributes

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SwitchProps` (`switch.tsx:27-39`): `thumbTransition` overrides the spring, `className`, `ref` and the rest spread on the row (`:273`).
- **Port:** `label`, `checked`, `onToggle`, `disabled`, `size` (`"default" | "compact"`, default the Size row) and a harness-only `testId` (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/switch.tsx:53-62`). Row padding, gap and text come from `METRICS` (`:21-46`), which match `sizeMap` (px-3 / gap-2 / body 13/20 default; px-2.5 / gap-1 / 12/18 compact).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped for the props; exact for the two built-in sizes.
- **Components it hits:** every ported component.

## Demo has more rows than the source page, and no code or props table

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the extra rows drive the screenshot scenarios, `apps/demo/src/demos/switch.tsx:79-129`); the missing chrome is `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `app/docs/switch/page.tsx:43-62`: "Basic" (`Notifications`, stateful) and "Disabled" (`Disabled option`, off), each with a code toggle, and an API Reference props table (`:27-32`, `:64-66`). Page description "Toggle switch with animated thumb and label." (`:41`).
- **Port:** `apps/demo/src/demos/switch.tsx:16-73`: Basic, Disabled, plus On, Keyboard (with a "Keys on/off" caption) and Compact, which the source page does not show (its compact switch only appears through the sizes page's `SizeProvider`). No code toggle, no props table, no description.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** both source variants present with the same copy; the rest is dropped.
- **Components it hits:** every demo page (the card chrome is in `apps/demo/src/lib/demo-kit.tsx`).
