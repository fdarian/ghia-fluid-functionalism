# input-copy

Original: `registry/default/input-copy.tsx`, demo in `app/docs/input-copy/page.tsx` of the source
(fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/input-copy.tsx`,
demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/input-copy.tsx`.

One entry per place the port looks or behaves differently from the source, whatever the cause. Shared gpuix gaps
(selector `:has(.x)` and group-has) get a one-line entry here that links to the README row instead of
repeating it.

## The monospace face is Menlo

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** Tailwind `font-mono` (`input-copy.tsx:345`): `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, …`, resolved by the browser. The site sets no `--font-mono` of its own.
- **Port:** `MONO = "Menlo"` (`input-copy.tsx:36`, `:281`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated (same face in Chrome on macOS, not in Safari, where `ui-monospace` is SF Mono).

## The tooltip's "Copied" reset runs on the row, not the whole field

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave` sit on the wrapper, so entering the label re-arms the tooltip and leaving it closes a "Copied" one (`input-copy.tsx:138-140,399`).
- **Port:** the handlers are on the row (`input-copy.tsx:321-322`), so the label does not count. The press snapshot (`tooltipOpenAtPress`) is read from the tooltip's `onOpenChange` like the source's ref, and a keyboard press reuses the last pointer snapshot as the source does.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (label hover only).

## The label is not part of the accessible name

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `aria-labelledby={`${buttonId} ${labelId}`}` with `aria-label` "Copy" when a label is set, so the name reads "Copy <label>" (`input-copy.tsx:372-381`).
- **Port:** `aria-label` is "Copy to clipboard" whether or not a label is shown (`input-copy.tsx:310-316`); the label `<text>` is not referenced. gpuix accepts `aria-labelledby` (`ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:124`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## A refused write has no `execCommand` fallback

- **Cause:** `port choice` (a native window has no insecure context or permissions policy to fall back from, and gpuix has no `document.execCommand`).
- **Original:** `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, then an off-screen textarea and `execCommand("copy")` when that throws; the error state shows only if both fail (`input-copy.tsx:77-110`).
- **Port:** `navigator.clipboard.writeText(value)`; when it rejects the component shows the error state, as the source does when its fallback fails too (`input-copy.tsx:123-127`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact where the write succeeds; a refused write shows the error at once instead of trying a second way.

## Passthrough props

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `...props`, `className` and `ref` go to the wrapper div (`input-copy.tsx:385`, `:396-401`).
- **Port:** no `className`, `ref` or rest props. The port adds `testId`. An omitted `size` follows the Size row (`input-copy.tsx:108`).
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** every component with `size` (input-group, input-message).

## Demo page

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the demo is a showcase card, not a docs page; reason not stated beyond that).
- **Original:** `app/docs/input-copy/page.tsx`: Basic, With Label, Button Variant, Left Aligned (icon and button, `gap-4`), Disabled, Copy Callback (`gap-2` to a caption with `px-1`), each in a `ComponentPreview` with its code, then a props table.
- **Port:** all six variants exist (`apps/demo/src/demos/input-copy.tsx:31-86`), stacked in one card at `gap: 8` (`:31`), the callback caption at `gap: 4` (`:72`). Extra: "Compact". The code snippets and props table are not ported.
- **Fidelity:** all source variants present; one extra.
