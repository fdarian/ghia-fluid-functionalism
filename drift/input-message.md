# input-message

Original: `registry/default/input-message.tsx`, demo in `app/docs/input-message/` of the source
(fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/input-message.tsx`,
demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/input-message.tsx`.

One entry per place the port looks or behaves differently from the source, whatever the cause. Shared gpuix gaps
(selector `:has(.x)` and group-has) get a one-line entry here that links to the README row instead of
repeating it.

## Queue drag-reorder does not follow the pointer

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `Reorder.Group` / `Reorder.Item` (axis y): the row follows the pointer while the others animate into place; the whole row is the handle (`cursor-grab`, `active:cursor-grabbing`), and a double click anywhere on it edits (`input-message.tsx:301-340,1135-1158`).
- **Port:** pointer capture on the label region only; the row under the pointer swaps with the one it crosses by a fixed stride of `row + 4` (`dragQueued`, `input-message.tsx:788-794`), nothing follows the cursor (the row it swaps past glides on `layout`, as the source's `Reorder.Item` does), and the file-count icon and padding are not draggable. Double click is `clickCount === 2` on the same region (`:431-445`). The fork has a `Reorder` primitive (`ghia:docs/fork/motion.md:92`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** queued-stack.

## The collapsing regions animate differently

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the files, queue and suggestions regions open with `spring.moderate`; the exit has no override, so it uses the same spring (`input-message.tsx:1098-1101,1130-1132,1339-1345`). The suggestions region exits on height only, so its divider holds until the space closes (comment at `:1340-1343`). `AnimatePresence initial={false}`: a region already open at mount does not animate (`:1094,1125,1334`).
- **Port:** `Collapse` exits on the 120 ms tween (`tween.moderateExit`, `input-message.tsx:125,148`), fades opacity on exit for every region including suggestions (`:153-156`), and its `initial` is always `{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }` (`:152`), so a region open at mount (the Attachments demo's two files) animates in.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (the divider vanishing mid-collapse is what the source comment avoids).

## Drag-over has no state

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** a file drag over the composer turns the ring `#6B97FF`, changes the placeholder to "Drop files here to add to chat" and hides the ghost (`input-message.tsx:507,574,653-656,1007-1027,1189-1195`).
- **Port:** `onDragOver` only calls `preventDefault` so the drop is delivered (`input-message.tsx:943-946`); the drop adds the files (`:950-955`).
- **Fidelity:** dropped.

## Files are paths, not `File`s

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`. gpuix hands over paths from a drop or the picker, never a `File` (`input-message.tsx:44`).
- **Original:** `File[]`, identity `name-size-lastModified`, type from the browser (`input-message.tsx:946-967`).
- **Workaround:** `ComposerFile { path, name, type }`, identity is the path, and the type comes from a ten-entry extension table; anything else is `application/octet-stream` and fails the default `accept` (`input-message.tsx:43-103`). `onSend`, `files` and `QueuedMessage.files` carry `ComposerFile`.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** any component taking a `File`; the demo maps `ComposerFile` to chat-message's `{ name, type, src }` by hand (`apps/demo/src/lib/composer-stage.tsx:42-46`).

## The file picker is not filtered by `accept`

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** a hidden `<input type="file" accept multiple>`; `openFilePicker(acceptOverride)` narrows `accept` for one call, so the OS dialog only offers those types (`input-message.tsx:977-996,1074-1083`).
- **Port:** `renderer.promptForPaths({ files, multiple })` shows every file; the result is filtered afterwards (`input-message.tsx:698-716`). The fork lists file-picker `accept` filters (`ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:131`, `ghia:docs/fork/deviations.md:277`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Clicking the composer's padding does not focus the textarea

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. A bug, listed in the report.
- **Original:** `onMouseDown` on the whole composer focuses the textarea and cancels the default unless the target is a button, link, input, textarea or the queue (`input-message.tsx:912-928,1051`), so the padding, the footer gaps, the file row and the suggestions' padding all focus.
- **Port:** `onClick` on the inner wrapper around the textarea only (`input-message.tsx:1033-1042`). The cursor is `text` over the whole box (`:966-969`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated (focus lands on release, and only over the textarea).

## The caret is not moved after a programmatic value change

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (unverified: where gpuix puts the caret after a programmatic change).
- **Original:** after accepting a suggestion, editing a queued message, or recalling history the caret is set to the end (`input-message.tsx:587-592,728-733,781-786`).
- **Port:** `focusTextarea()` only (`input-message.tsx:667-677,758-770,885-906`).

## History recalls only from a single-line draft

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. The port's comment blames gpuix (`input-message.tsx:884`: "gpuix does not report the caret"), but the fork lists `selectionStart` / `selectionEnd` (`ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:117`). Not checked on a textarea.
- **Original:** ArrowUp recalls when the caret is on the first line, ArrowDown when it is on the last, so a multi-line draft still navigates (`input-message.tsx:846-889`).
- **Port:** recalls only when the draft has no `\n` (`input-message.tsx:879-884`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Arrow keys may not reach the textarea's `onKeyDown`

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`, as the port's comment states (`input-message.tsx:825-826`). Unverified here: `ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:113` says a text editor's `keydown` runs before its built-in action. No README row covers it.
- **Original:** plain ArrowUp / ArrowDown drive the suggestion list and history (`input-message.tsx:788-889`).
- **Port:** the same handler also accepts Ctrl-P / Ctrl-N (`input-message.tsx:812-836`), and the demo's scenarios use `ctrl-n` / `ctrl-p` (`apps/demo/src/demos/input-message.tsx:646,764`). If the arrows really are swallowed, the keyboard path in the real window is Ctrl-P / Ctrl-N only.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Slot buttons are not scaled down in compact

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the footer sets `[&_button]:h-6 [&_button.w-7]:w-6` and the caption text size on every descendant button in compact, so the consumer's slot buttons and the send button are 24px (`input-message.tsx:1270-1272`).
- **Port:** only the send button is 24 (`steps.compact.button`, `input-message.tsx:111`); slot content keeps its own size.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Queued row icon strokes

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the image, enter and down-arrow icons pass no `strokeWidth`, so they draw at lucide's 2 (`input-message.tsx:344,443,448`).
- **Port:** strokes of 1.5 (`input-message.tsx:415,568,577`).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## The ghost placeholder

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the overlay is `absolute inset-0 overflow-hidden` and is described to assistive tech by an `sr-only` hint wired through `aria-describedby` (`input-message.tsx:1225-1261`).
- **Port:** `top / left / right` without `bottom` or clipping (`input-message.tsx:1091-1106`); no hint text.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Accessibility wiring

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. gpuix accepts `aria-*` (`ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:124`).
- **Original:** `aria-activedescendant` on the textarea and an `id` on each option (`input-message.tsx:1204-1208,419`), a polite `role="status"` live region announcing "Message sent. N still queued." (`:708-710,1390-1392`), `aria-describedby` merging the ghost hint and `textareaProps` (`:1199-1203`).
- **Port:** `role="listbox"` / `option` / `aria-selected` and `listitem` labels are there (`input-message.tsx:529-530,1194-1195,366-367`); none of the three above.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.

## Props: no passthrough

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `className`, `style`, `ref` and the div's HTML attributes on the root; `textareaProps` (a custom `aria-label`, `className`, `onFocus` / `onBlur`, `maxLength`, …) on the textarea (`input-message.tsx:126-210,491-495,513-519,1070,1219`).
- **Port:** `InputMessageProps` has neither (`input-message.tsx:586-630`); the textarea's `aria-label` is fixed "Message" (`:1051`). `testId` is added.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.

## IME composition

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` on macOS, `gpuix gap` on Windows and Linux.
- **Original:** the Enter handler returns early while `isComposing` (`input-message.tsx:790`).
- **Port:** no early return; the handler acts on every key. macOS reports `isComposing` and Windows and Linux do not (`ghia:docs/fork/events-and-input.md:111`, `ghia:docs/fork/deviations.md:275`; README "Missing features", IME row, which lists input-message).
- **Fidelity:** approximated (unverified for composed input).

## Touch

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`. The touch-only always-visible × (`useIsTouch`, `:77-87,367-368`; README, the `matchMedia` input-device row).

## Demo page

- **Cause:** `port choice` for the shape (the demo is a showcase card, not a docs page; reason not stated beyond that); `not ported yet` for what is missing.
- **Original:** `app/docs/input-message/page.tsx`: Playground (toggles for placeholder suggestion, prompts, history, attachments, min rows, disabled, slots, queue status), Basic, Suggestions, Attachments (composer floating over a scrolling transcript, pre-filled, a Reset button), Queued messages (`queued-chat-demo.tsx`: a pausable streaming reply, `showQueue={false}` with the `QueuedStack` above the composer, the queued-to-sent morph, a `rich` variant with an attach dropdown and a model picker, Reset), Left Slot Only, Right Slot Only, Send Handler (no history), Disabled (text "This composer is disabled"), then a props table. Each has a `ComponentPreview` with code.
- **Port:** Playground (every control and the shuffle; `apps/demo/src/demos/input-message.tsx`), Basic, Suggestions, Attachments (pre-filled, a transcript that scrolls under the composer and stays pinned to its end, Reset), Queued messages (`apps/demo/src/lib/queued-chat.tsx`: pausable stream, the stack over the composer with `showQueue={false}`, Reset), the same with the rich attach menu and model picker, a built-in-rows queue card, both slots in one card, Send handler (with `history` added), Disabled (empty value) with Compact. Missing: code snippets, props table. Extras: history, compact, the built-in-rows card.
- **Fidelity:** every source section has a port counterpart.

## Playground: what differs

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (Get code); `port choice` (the preview frame is a `DemoCard`, as for every playground).
- **Original:** the panel ends with a "Get code" dialog (preset codes, `usePresetUrlSync`) and the Code tab shows a snippet generated from the toggles; the left slot is `Tooltip` "Attach" with an `icon-sm` button; the preview is 560px with compact padding.
- **Port:** no Get code, no snippet. The stage is 480px in the card's 20px padding. The left slot and the stack's tooltips are the same. Every control, default and the shuffle match.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Queued chat: what differs

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap` (the morph has no crossfade and starts where a scroll shifts it, see `drift/queued-stack.md` "Shared-layout morph into the sent bubble"; queue types); `not ported yet` (menu placement, edit focus).
- **Original:** the front card morphs into its sent bubble (`morphLayoutId` on the stack and `layoutId` on `ChatMessage`; the shared layout fades the bubble in over the card); the attach and model menus open above their buttons (`bottom-full`); the buttons are lit while their menu is open (`active`) and wrapped in tooltips; editing a card puts the caret at the end of the composer.
- **Port:** the morph, without the crossfade and with a start that a scroll shifts (`drift/queued-stack.md`): `ComposerQueueStack` takes `morph`, the `Transcript` a `morphingId`, and `ChatMessage` a `morphId` (the source spreads `layoutId`, `layout`, `initial` and `transition` onto it).  `DropdownContent` has no side prop, so the menus open below the composer's slot buttons. `Button` has no `active` prop. Edit refills the composer but does not focus it: `InputMessage` has no ref and gpuix has no way to find its textarea from outside. The composer's `QueuedMessage` carries `ComposerFile`s and the stack's carries `FileLike`s, so `ComposerQueueStack` (`apps/demo/src/lib/composer-stage.tsx`) maps between them, caching one mapped object per message because the stack keys its cards by identity.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Sample photo: a different picture, named avatar.jpg

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the repository owner chose not to ship the source's photo).
- **Original:** the source's `public/micka.png` (918x928 PNG), fetched and attached as a `File` named `micka.png` with type `image/png` (`app/docs/input-message/page.tsx:70-72`, `:604-606`) or `blob.type || "image/png"` in the playground (`lib/docs/playgrounds/input-message.tsx:252-254`).
- **Port:** `apps/demo/assets/chat-ai/avatar.jpg` (345x345 JPEG, `AVATAR_JPG` in `apps/demo/src/lib/assets.ts`), a `ComposerFile` by path with its `name` set to `avatar.jpg` and its type read from the extension, `image/jpeg` (`apps/demo/src/demos/input-message.tsx:40-43`, used at `:113` and `:325`; the queued chat's `PHOTO` is the same file, `apps/demo/src/lib/queued-chat.tsx:35`). The name only surfaces in the tile's `alt` and `aria-label` and the remove badge's label (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/file-thumbnail.tsx:129`, `:153`; `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/input-message.tsx:330`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.
