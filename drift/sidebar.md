# sidebar

Original: `registry/base/sidebar.tsx` over `registry/default/sidebar-core.tsx` and `sidebar-menu.tsx` (plus the older `nav-menu.tsx` / `nav-item.tsx` and `registry/blocks/sidebar-*`), demo in `app/docs/sidebar/page.tsx` of the source
(fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar.tsx`.
The site's own navigation sidebar is covered at the end: source `app/components/sidebar.tsx` and `sidebar-layout.tsx`, port `NavGroup` and `AppSidebar` in `apps/demo/src/app.tsx:105-257`. That section reads the live site (fluidfunctionalism.com at d5c3606: it has the Changelog page and the release-driven New dots, which 0a0377e predates), so its source `file:line` refs are d5c3606's.

The port is the menu only: `SidebarMenu` (one fluid-hover scope with a hover, an active-per-level and a focus-ring overlay), `SidebarMenuButton` (`label`, `icon`, `dot`, `badge`, `expanded`), `SidebarMenuSub`, and a fixed 256px `Sidebar` with `SidebarHeader`, `SidebarContent`, `SidebarGroupLabel` and `SidebarSearchField`. Everything else in the source is absent. Numbers that match (row 32 / sub-row 28 / label 32 high, 8px gap and left pad, radius 8, 16px icons, sub-menu `ml 15 + 1px border + pl 8`, badge slot 24 at right 8 with a 36px reserved pad, 256px width, header `p 8 gap 8`, hover / active tokens) are not listed.

Shared gpuix gaps that hit this component, each in its README row and not repeated here: [`createMeasuredHeight`](../README.md) (the sub-menu height tween runs on `onLayout`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:564`).

## Collapse, `SidebarProvider`, shell, trigger and shortcut

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarProvider` owns open / mobile state, the `[` / `]` toggle key (`sidebar-core.tsx:47,208-290`), the `sidebar_state` cookie (`:43`) and a controllable width. `SidebarShell` springs the column's width to 0 on `spring.slow` while the panel slides out (`:556-760`, `peek="hover" | "click"` edge strip and floating card at `:600-690`). `SidebarTrigger` is a ghost icon button with an "Expand / Collapse sidebar" tooltip and the key chip (`:908-995`).
- **Port:** none. `Sidebar` is a fixed `SIDEBAR_WIDTH = 256` column (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:51,549-570`) with no open state, no key, no trigger, no peek.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Rail: drag to resize, click to collapse

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarRail` on the inner edge: drag clamps to 160-360px, dragging 56px past the minimum previews the collapse and drag-back re-expands, a click collapses, a `Tooltip` explains it, the edge hairline brightens on hover (`sidebar-core.tsx:1001-1130`, constants `:50-55`). `Sidebar` renders it by default (`rail`, `railTooltipOpen`, `registry/base/sidebar.tsx:168-172`).
- **Port:** none. README lists "rail resize" as not ported.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Mobile drawer (`SidebarSheet`)

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the plan scoped it out, `base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:673`; the app is a fixed desktop window, which the README does not state as the reason).
- **Original:** below `mobileBreakpoint` (768) the desktop shell fades out and `SidebarSheet` mounts: a Base UI Dialog sliding in on `spring.moderate`, scrim `bg-black/40` (`/80` dark), `initialFocus` on the panel, exit held until the spring lands, reduced motion drops the slide (`registry/base/sidebar.tsx:57-149`, `sidebar-core.tsx:512-540`).
- **Port:** none; no breakpoint, no sheet, `openMobile` does not exist.
- **Workaround:** none. `mobile-drawer` is a separate component with its own drift file.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Variants, side and the inner-edge border

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `variant="sidebar" | "floating" | "inset"` (floating is a rounded `surface-3` card in a `p-2` gutter, inset a `py-2` rail beside a rounded `SidebarInset`), `side="left" | "right"` (mirrors the rail, key and slide), `collapsible="none"`, and `bordered` (default: a 1px `border-border` on the inner edge) (`registry/base/sidebar.tsx:157-263`, `sidebar-core.tsx:760-905`, `:1132-1160`).
- **Port:** one layout: left, no border, `color.background` fill, optional `leftCornerRadius` for the app frame (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:583-604`). The site's own sidebar uses `bordered={false}` (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:90`), so the borderless look matches the site but not the docs' default `Sidebar` layout.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped for floating, inset and right; approximated for the default (no border).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Parts that are not ported

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarInset` (`sidebar-core.tsx:1132`), `SidebarSeparator` (`:1221`), `SidebarGroup` (`p-2` wrapper, `collapsible` accordion with `open` / `defaultOpen` / `onOpenChange`, measured-height collapse, label turns into a toggle with a hover-revealed chevron on `spring.fast`, `:1258-1417,1419-1520`), `SidebarGroupAction` / `SidebarGroupActions` (24px icon buttons overlaid on the label row, up to 3, `:1558-1650`), `SidebarGroupContent`, `SidebarMenuItem` / `SidebarMenuSubItem` (the `li` rows), `SidebarMenuAction` / `SidebarMenuActions` (`showOnHover`, `sidebar-menu.tsx:1089-1260`), `SidebarMenuSkeleton` (pulsing placeholder rows, `sidebar-menu.tsx:1266`), `SidebarMenuSubButton` as its own part with `size sm | md`.
- **Port:** the menu button, sub-menu, group label and the header / content / footer frame only (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx`); `SidebarFooter` is `p 8 gap 8` without the source's `mt-auto` (the content column grows, so it lands at the bottom anyway). Item and sub-item are folded into `SidebarMenuButton` (`level={1}`), the badge into its `badge` prop.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Row actions and the trailing gutter

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** actions sit at `right-1.5` (left of a badge at `right-8.5`), reveal on the row's own button hover or focus, and the row reserves `rowGutter(actionCount, hasBadge)` of right padding that widens on reveal (`sidebar-menu.tsx:733-760,904`). Hover tracking freezes while an action popup is open (`:363`).
- **Port:** a fixed right pad: 8px, or 36px when a badge is set (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:354-355`). No actions, no gutter maths, no popup freeze.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Row sizes and the outline variant

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarMenuButton size="default" | "sm" | "lg"` (32 or 28 compact, 28, 48), `variant="outline"` (1px border, `bg-background`), `SidebarMenu size="default" | "compact"` follows the `SizeProvider` (`sidebar-menu.tsx:935-1010`, `:1279`). `sm` also drops the label to the compact body step.
- **Port:** two fixed heights from level: `height.menuRow` 32 and `height.menuSubRow` 28 (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:353`); text always `scale.body` (13/20). No compact ladder, no `lg`, no outline.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Status dot and the `dot` prop

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `status="active" | "unread" | "idle"` leads the row with a filled or ringed 8px dot in the icon column (`bg-foreground/60` lit, `bg-muted-foreground/50` at rest), stamps `data-status`, adds visually-hidden ", unread", and `active` implies `isActive`; `dot="filled" | "ring"` is the visual-only escape hatch (`sidebar-menu.tsx:898-1042`). The site's New dot is a separate 6px trailing span the page composes as a child, in the changelog's `KIND_DOT.new` (`bg-[var(--info)]`) with an `sr-only` "New" (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:28-38`).
- **Port:** only the trailing 6px dot, and it is the `dot` prop (a colour string) with `dotLabel`, which the dot carries as `role="img"` and `aria-label` in place of the `sr-only` span (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:297-299,427-441`). The site nav passes `kindDotColor("new")`, the same `info` token (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:196-197`). The prop name means the opposite of the source's `dot`, and the leading status dots do not exist.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact for the site's trailing dot (same 6px, same gap, label hugs the text); dropped for `status`.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Semantics and `aria-current`

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `ul` / `li` lists with `aria-label` on each menu ("Main navigation", "System navigation", ...), the row is a `button` (or `a` through `render`), `aria-current="page"` only while active (the attribute is absent otherwise), sub-menu `aria-hidden` and `data-state` while closed (`sidebar-menu.tsx:1062,1385`, `app/components/sidebar.tsx:75,99`).
- **Port:** a `div` with `buttonProps` (role `button`) and `aria-current="page"` only while active, absent otherwise (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:360-378`). No `aria-label` on menus, no list roles, a collapsed sub-menu stays in the tree (its rows are `disabled`: skipped by hover, Tab, the arrows and activation, but still exposed to assistive tech).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Disabled rows

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** a disabled row stays in the layout at `opacity-50`, never lights, never takes a click and is skipped by the keyboard (`sidebar-menu.tsx:109-120,904`).
- **Port:** `disabled` is a function the sub-menu uses for its collapsed rows (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:306,327`). It takes the row out of the hover, the tab stops, the arrow order, and blocks click, Enter and Space (a pointer cannot reach a collapsed row anyway: the sub-menu's `overflow: hidden` clips its hit area). It adds no dimming, and a public disabled row does not exist.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## A click between rows lands on the highlighted row (`gapClick`)

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the container's `onClick` is the fluid-hover handler: a click on the gutter, the sub-menu's `ml-15` strip or any padding presses the row the highlight sits on (`sidebar-menu.tsx:568`, `use-fluid-hover`).
- **Port:** the container wires `containerProps` (enter / move / leave only), so a click off a row does nothing (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:245`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/fluid-hover.ts:321-327`). The hover can still sit on a row while the click falls through.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** every fluid-hover list (README lists `gapClick` as not ported).

## Label truncation

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (the dotted row).
- **Original:** the label and its ghost both `truncate`, so a long label ends in an ellipsis and never wraps the row (`sidebar-menu.tsx:864-885`).
- **Port:** `SidebarMenuButton` passes `truncate` to `StableLabel` (an optional prop added for it: the label's grid is one `minmax(0, 1fr)` column inside a `minWidth: 0` wrapper, and all three cells are `nowrap`, `overflow: hidden` and `textOverflow: "ellipsis"`), so a long thread title ends in an ellipsis before the badge (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/stable-label.tsx`). A row with a `dot` hugs its text and does not truncate. Every other `StableLabel` user wraps its label inside the inline-grid like the source's `inline-grid` span, and takes `nowrap` where the source's labels never wrap (tabs, tabs-subtle).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact for a plain or badged row; dropped for a dotted row (it hugs its text and does not truncate).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Badge: `pointer-events-none`

- **Cause:** `port choice` (decorative `pointerEvents: none` was dropped on purpose, see the README).
- **Original:** the badge is `pointer-events-none`, its digits `tabular-nums` (`sidebar-menu.tsx:1239`).
- **Port:** the digits are tabular too (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:484-518`); the badge box is a normal hit target (the README says decorative `pointerEvents: none` was dropped on purpose).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Highlight opacity fade is the position spring, not an 80 ms tween

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the hover highlight keeps its positional spring but fades on `{ duration: 0.08 }` (`fluid-hover-highlight.tsx:resolveHighlightTransition`); the active background moves on `spring.moderate` with `opacity: { duration: 0.08 }` (`sidebar-menu.tsx:520-524`). Reduced motion keeps the fade and drops the travel.
- **Port:** `FluidHighlight` passes one transition for both position and opacity (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/fluid-highlight.tsx:59-63,90`), so the fade runs on the spring (0.08 s hover, 0.16 s active). gpuix accepts per-property transitions (`MotionTransition` `{ [prop]: curve }`, `packages/native/js/host.ts:304-308`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (the fade is about the same length for hover, twice as long for the active background).
- **Components it hits:** every `FluidHighlight` user.

## One active background per level

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** every active row gets a background, keyed by level and occurrence, so two active rows in one sub-menu both light (`sidebar-menu.tsx:462-476`), at any nesting depth; the key survives a move so it glides.
- **Port:** exactly two overlays, level 0 and level 1, each on the first active row of its level (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:217-232,254-281`). `level` is typed `0 | 1`; a deeper tree has no overlay.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Group label: the library label is not the site's header

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the site's header is built in the app, as `NavGroup`; the library `SidebarGroupLabel` keeps its own plainer look).
- **Original:** the site's count is a `h-5 min-w-5 px-1` centred box in the label row, `tabular-nums`, `text-site-caption` (12/16), so its digits share the badge column (centre 18px from the right edge); the name is `text-foreground`; a `h-px bg-border` hairline (`ml-2 mr-3 mb-1`) sits under both, and a labelled `SidebarGroup` is `p-2 pt-4`, so groups are 16px apart below the first (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:55-74`).
- **Port:** the site nav is exact: `NavGroup` has the foreground name, the 20px count box, the hairline and the 16px top padding (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:105-181`). The library `SidebarGroupLabel` (the demo page's) keeps its `count` prop as a bare `caption` text right-aligned at 8px, so a two-digit count ends 4px right of the badge column; it has no hairline, and its groups touch (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:673-704`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact in the site nav; approximated in the library label.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Search field (`SidebarInput` + search block)

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarInput` is `h-8` (`h-7` compact), `px-3`, `bg-transparent` with `ring-1 ring-transparent`; hover `bg-muted/50` + `ring-border`; focus `bg-card` + `ring-border`; and `focus-visible:ring-[--focus-ring]` (a text input matches `:focus-visible` on any focus, so a focused field shows the blue ring). Fill and ring ease over 80 ms (`sidebar-core.tsx:1165-1195`). The block adds the icon at `left-2`, `pl-8 pr-12`, `aria-label="Search"`, default placeholder `Search…` and a chip `⌘K` that fades in on hover or focus over 80 ms, or `shortcut={null}` to drop it (`registry/blocks/sidebar-app/search-field.tsx`).
- **Port:** hover fill `mutedHalf`, focus fill `card`, and the outline is `color.border` for both hover and focus, never the focus-ring colour (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:707-787`). Fill, outline and chip ease over 80 ms (the outline stands in for the source's `ring-1` box shadow). No `aria-label`; the demo passes `placeholder="Search"` without the ellipsis (`apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar.tsx:73`); the chip cannot be dropped (`shortcut` is required). Size is fixed at 32 (`height.menuRow`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Content scroller: the start hairline is never drawn

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarContent` is a `ScrollArea` with `scroll-fade` (48px edge mask) and `scroll-divider` hairlines inset 8px at the top and bottom edges while there is more to scroll (`registry/base/sidebar.tsx:276-304`, `app/globals.css:1128-1196`). `.scroll-divider:first-child::before` hides the top one when nothing sits above the scroller, which is the site nav's case (its Search row scrolls inside it) but not a sidebar with a `SidebarHeader` over its content (`app/globals.css:1184`).
- **Port:** `SidebarContent` is a `ScrollArea` with `fade` and `divider={{ start: false }}`: the 48px fade follows the scroll, and the end hairline fades in over the last 48px (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:644-671`). The start hairline is dropped for every use, so the demo page's sidebar, which has a header above its content, lacks the top one the source draws there. The site nav matches the source, Search row inside the scroller (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:209-221`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact for the site nav; approximated for the demo's sidebar.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Demo: which variants exist

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the docs page (`app/docs/sidebar/page.tsx:1836-1992`) has: Playground (provider / sidebar / layout options), Layouts (sidebar, floating, inset, each a 640px shell with a `SidebarInset` beside it), Nesting (two levels, one section level and one parent level), Actions and badges (up to 3 actions, `showOnHover`), Header and footer (vertical and horizontal stacking), Callouts (stacked inlines and banners), Resize / collapse / peek (on hover, on click, with the rail tooltip pinned), Inside a dialog (`collapsible="none"` in a settings dialog), No icon rail version (scripted icon-rail vs peek comparison), Functional and perfectly aligned (alignment guides), and five API reference tables.
- **Port:** two cards. The Playground (see "Playground" below) covers Nesting, badges, Header and footer stacking and Callouts. The "Sidebar" card keeps the site-nav sample: a search field, a flat `Showcase` row, a "System" group of four rows, a "Components" group with a collapsible "Button" row (`Variants`, `Sizes`, `Icons`) (`apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar.tsx`). Scenarios: the playground's controls, then hover, hover over a label, sub-menu, sub-menu collapsed, keyboard focus. `apps/demo/scripts/check-sidebar.tsx` also checks Tab, the arrows, Enter, Space, `aria-current` and the collapsed rows. Not ported as their own sections: Layouts, Actions (the actions need `SidebarMenuAction`), Resize / collapse / peek, Inside a dialog, the icon-rail comparison, the alignment guides, the API tables.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped for every section but Nesting, badges, Header and footer and Callouts.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Playground

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (the controls below), `port choice` (the preview shell).
- **Original:** `lib/docs/playgrounds/sidebar.tsx`: Layout (Design, Collapsed behavior, State), Header (Primary element, Stacking, Header actions), Sections (Collapsible, Section actions), Content level 1 (Primary element, Has children, Actions, Badges), Content level 2 (Leading icon, Actions, Badges), Footer (Primary element, Stacking, Footer actions, Callout, Stacked), a "Get code" dialog and a generated snippet.
- **Port:** the controls with a part behind them: Header Stacking and Header actions, Content level 1 Primary element / Has children / Badges, Content level 2 Leading icon / Badges, Footer Stacking / Footer actions / Callout / Stacked, with the source's defaults, disabled rules (threads do not nest, level 2 needs children, Stacked needs a callout) and shuffle odds (`apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar/playground.tsx`). **Left out:** Design (floating / inset / sidebar: no `variant`), Collapsed behavior (no peek), State (no open state, no `SidebarMenuSkeleton` for Loading), Header Primary element (no workspace-header block), Sections Collapsible and Section actions (no `SidebarGroup` / `SidebarGroupAction`), Content level 1 and 2 Actions (no `SidebarMenuAction`), Footer Primary element (no user-footer block), Get code, the snippet. Also differs: the shell is always the inset look, drawn in the demo as the rail beside a plain rounded `surface(2)` div (no `SidebarInset`, no trigger in a topbar, no shadow); the frame is a fixed 520px tall (source: the stage's height); the thread rows have no leading status dot (no `status`, see "Status dot"); the vertical header's action rows have no hover-revealed shortcut chip and the horizontal buttons' tooltips no shortcut; a parent row's chevron swaps glyphs and never hides at rest (see "Sub-menu chevron"); no tooltips on the footer rows; the sub-menu is not removed from the tree while collapsed (clipped to 0 height).
- **Callout:** `Card size="compact" dismissible` on a `surface(2)` wrapper (`apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar/callout.tsx`). Differs from the source's card: no `href` (it is a no-op `onClick` so the card still lights), no `surfaceHoverClasses` rise or inset-shadow ring (a flat `surface(2)` fill; the banner card lights with the card's own hover fill, the inline card, inside a `CardGroup` with its hover off, does not light at all), the inline tile has no brand-blue tint or glyph colour, the inline card is 12px left padded (source 10) with a 60px floor (source `min-h-0`), the title / description gap is 4 (source 2), and the banner mesh is rebuilt from the card demo's data URI with scaled opacities. The stacked pile is the source's: peek 12, scale 0.05, gap 4, two peeks, each card on `y` and `scale` about its bottom centre.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated for the controls ported, dropped for those left out.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Demo: frame and data

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated; the data is the site's nav rather than the docs page's "Aurora AI" product).
- **Original:** each preview is a full shell (sidebar and `SidebarInset` content) 640px tall (560 on a phone), `bg-background`, workspace header with a switcher, a user footer with a dropdown, rows with icons (`app/docs/sidebar/page.tsx:SHELL_HEIGHT`, `example-data.ts`: Chat, Agents, Knowledge, Runs, Evals, with sub-rows and badges).
- **Port:** the sidebar alone in a 480px-tall `shape.container`-radius box inside a `DemoCard` (`apps/demo/src/demos/sidebar.tsx`), no inset content, no header brand row, no footer, icon-less rows, no badges (the `badge` prop is demoed only by the Playground). The dots are the site nav's of 0a0377e: blue is a fixed `#3B82F6` (`bg-blue-500`), the other is `color.warning` (`var(--warning)`), read per paint so it follows the theme. The live nav's New dot is the one `info` token, which the demo does not use.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Blocks: workspace header, user footer, app sidebar, inset top bar, settings dialog

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `registry/blocks/sidebar-workspace-header.tsx` (brand row with a workspace dropdown, tile / trigger cross-fade while peeking), `sidebar-user-footer.tsx` (avatar row, dropdown opening upward on the shared grid), `sidebar-app/*` (`AppSidebar`, `nav-data.ts` Platform / Workspace, `inset-topbar.tsx`, `page.tsx`), `dialog-sidebar/settings-dialog.tsx` (a dialog with the sidebar inside, a Select under `sm`). Only the search-field block is ported (folded in as `SidebarSearchField`). The dropdown's `side="top"` is also absent (`base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:405`; `drift/dialog.md` for the settings dialog).
- **Port:** none of the others.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** dropdown, dialog.

## `nav-menu` and `nav-item`

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `registry/default/nav-menu.tsx` + `nav-item.tsx`: the predecessor of the sidebar menu. One fluid-hover `nav` with an active-route background keyed by `activeSlug`, a traveling focus ring, arrow / Home / End keys and a roving tabindex; `NavItem` is a `Link` with `isNew` / `isUpdated` dots (`nav-menu.tsx:48-217`, `nav-item.tsx:24-131`). The site no longer uses them (the sidebar replaced them; only the bento and concepts pages mention "NavMenu").
- **Port:** not ported; the sidebar menu is the one fluid nav.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

# The site's own navigation sidebar

## Pages and groups

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the port has four more demos than the source has components, and keeps them out of the nav).
- **Original:** Search, then Showcase, Introduction and Changelog, then a "System" group (Fluid Hover, Motion, Scrollbars, Sizes, Skill, Surfaces, Typography) and a "Components" group of 28, each with a count; the labels are the component names (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:99-141`, `lib/docs/components.ts`).
- **Port:** the same rows in the same order: Search, the "Pages" modules listed `"sidebar"` (Showcase, then Introduction and Changelog by `order`), "System" with 7 and "Components" with 28, the demos listed `"sidebar"`, labelled with their titles, which are the component names as written in code. The four port-only demos, file-thumbnail, mobile-drawer, queued-stack and scroll-area, are listed `"menu"`: in the site menu, absent from the nav, the count and the prev / next order. The Compare, Audio Mixer and Concepts pages have no row, as in the source (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:183-257`, `apps/demo/src/lib/page-nav.ts:5-23`; `drift/site.md`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact for the nav; approximated overall (four demos are reachable from the site menu only).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Rail frame: margin, fill, corners

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the sidebar sits inside the app frame's rounded panel; reason for the fill not stated).
- **Original:** `Sidebar className="ml-2"`, `rail={false}`, no fill of its own, sticky `h-svh`, content `py-2` (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:98-99`).
- **Port:** no left margin; the column paints `color.background` and takes `leftCornerRadius={PANEL_INNER_RADIUS}` (9) so the fill follows the panel's corner (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:208`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:583-604`); content padding is `py-2` as the source's, made of the content's 8px sides and bottom and an 8px spacer above the first group (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:211`). The column is a sibling of the page scroller, not inside it, so it needs no `sticky h-svh` to stay put.
- **Workaround:** n/a.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** app frame.

## Collapse, reopen trigger, `[` toast, persistence

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SidebarLayout` runs `SidebarProvider` with the cookie-read `defaultOpen`; `[` collapses and a `showShortcutToast("[", "Sidebar expanded" | "Sidebar collapsed")` follows a key-driven change; a `DesktopReopenTrigger` fades in at the top-left (opacity and scale 0.95 on `spring.fast`) with its own tooltip; the page's `SidebarInset` reflows (`app/components/sidebar-layout.tsx:31-90,184-198`).
- **Port:** the sidebar is always open at 256px; no key, no toast, no trigger, no persistence (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:522-702`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** app frame.

## Mobile sheet and its "Make them yours" footer

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated; the app is a desktop window, so the breakpoint is never crossed).
- **Original:** below 1280 the sidebar is a drawer opened by a fixed top-left `SidebarTrigger` ("Open navigation"), closing on route change, with a footer holding "Make them yours" (title, GitHub star button, settings) (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:143-160`, `sidebar-layout.tsx:93-102,184-196`).
- **Port:** none; "Make them yours" is the right-hand `CustomizeCard` with a Theme select only (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:401-520`, mounted at `:676`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** app frame.

## Left / Right arrows page through the docs

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. Same drift as [site.md, "Arrow keys do not step through the pages"](site.md#arrow-keys-do-not-step-through-the-pages), where the entry lives (verified: the port's only key handler is ⌘K, `apps/demo/src/lib/site-command-menu.tsx:69-76`).
