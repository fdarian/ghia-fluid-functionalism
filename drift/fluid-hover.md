# fluid-hover

Original: `app/docs/fluid-hover/page.tsx` and `demos.tsx` of the source (fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`), with the page chrome of `lib/docs/DocPage.tsx` and `lib/docs/ComponentPreview.tsx`.
Ported in `apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover.tsx` (the page, prose and scenarios) with the demos under `apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/` (`plain-vs-fluid.tsx`, `show-the-math.tsx`, `axes.tsx`, `lists.tsx`, `cost.tsx`, the Code tab snippets in `snippets.ts`, the copy prompt in `install-prompt.ts`, the shared rows and cursor in `parts.tsx`), routed by the page registry (`apps/demo/src/lib/demo.ts` `loadPages`). The doc chrome (`DocPage`, `DocSection`, `Prose`, `Code`, `ComponentPreview`) is the shared `apps/demo/src/lib/doc-page.tsx`.

One entry per place the port looks or behaves differently from the source, whatever the cause. Shared gpuix gaps
(selector `:has(.x)` and group-has) get a one-line entry here that links to the README row instead of
repeating it. The heading and the missing prev / next arrows are the same drift as every page; see `drift/introduction.md`
and `drift/site.md`. The preview frame is the shared `ComponentPreview`, whose drift (no Inspect switch, no highlighting) is in
`drift/surfaces.md`.

## The "Reference" section is not ported

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the port has no API tables anywhere).
- **Original:** a "Reference" section with `PropsTable`s for the hook's options, its return value and `FluidHoverHighlight`'s props, plus the closing sentence about the transform (`page.tsx:25-48,155-187`).
- **Port:** none; the page ends at "Reduced motion". The `hookOptions`, `hookReturn` and `highlightProps` data are not carried over.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** every page whose source has a `PropsTable`.

## The Copy prompt button copies a fixed brief

- **Cause:** `port choice`.
- **Original:** `DocPage` renders the "Installation" block with `CopyPromptButton`, which copies `buildInstallPrompt({ slug: "fluid-hover", installSlug: "use-fluid-hover", base })`: the install command, the usage and props of `PROMPT_ENTRIES["fluid-hover"]`, the skill pointer and the docs URL (`lib/docs/DocPage.tsx:118-152`, `lib/docs/install-prompt.ts:38-95`, `lib/docs/prompt-entries.ts:27-66`).
- **Port:** the shared `DocPage` draws the block and the button, with the title and note verbatim (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover.tsx:Page`). The brief is that call written out for the Radix flavour in `apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/install-prompt.ts`, not built from the page registry; the button, its icon swap and the failed-copy handling are the ones in [motion-page.md](motion-page.md#the-copy-prompt-button-swaps-its-icon-at-once-and-copies-a-fixed-brief).
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** the Installation block of every docs page.

## The site menu has no "New" tag

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (the menu reads no release marks; the sidebar's dot does, `drift/sidebar.md`).
- **Original:** the latest changelog release lists Fluid Hover as New (`apps/demo/content/changelog/2026-09.md`): a blue dot in the sidebar and a "New" description in the site menu (`app/components/sidebar.tsx:82`, `app/components/site-command-menu.tsx:194-217`).
- **Port:** the sidebar row has the dot (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:229-247`); the menu row is plain. It has no icon, as in the source (`icon` is only set for the Pages group, `:203-204`), and `menuKeywords` is the slug plus the description's words, as the source builds them (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover.tsx:24-31`). It sorts first in System (`order = 1`), where the source sorts the System list alphabetically.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** every System page the latest release marks New or Updated (Skill, and Typography once its release lands).

## "Blink or glide": captions differ slightly

- **Cause:** `port choice` (captions).
- **Original:** the play / pause icon button is the right end of the preview header, 40px square, through `ComponentPreview`'s `playbackButton`; `useReducedMotion()` stops the script (`demos.tsx:288-292`, `:380-400`, `lib/docs/ComponentPreview.tsx:140-170`); the two captions are flex rows whose text and `<code>` runs are separate flex items 8px apart (`demos.tsx:344-376`).
- **Port:** the pause button is the same 40px header button, through the shared `ComponentPreview`'s `playback` option (icon, tooltip and click; `apps/demo/src/lib/doc-page.tsx:370-408`, `apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/plain-vs-fluid.tsx:240-256`). Reduced motion stops the script as in the source (`createReducedMotion()`, `apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/plain-vs-fluid.tsx:84-85`); each caption is one centred `<text>` with inline runs, so the gaps around the chip are a normal space.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## "Show the math": dash geometry

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap` (dash geometry).
- **Original:** `border-t border-dashed border-foreground/20` on an empty absolute box at each midpoint between row centres (`app/docs/fluid-hover/demos.tsx:459`); the distance label hangs off a zero-width rail and is translated by `-100% - 8px` and `-50%` (`:496`).
- **Port:** the same, a `borderTopWidth: 1`, `borderTopStyle: "dashed"` border in 20% foreground on an empty absolute box; the label is on `translate(calc(-100% - 8px), -50%)` from a zero-width rail 20px in (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/show-the-math.tsx:110-118`, `:171-202`, `apps/demo/scripts/check-show-the-math.tsx`). The dashes are gpuix's (two widths long with a gap of one, README "Borders"), so they read finer than the 3px / 3px the earlier gradient drew, and their phase is not checked against Chrome's. Everything else (cursor line at 70%, rail at 20px, dots 8px with their 150 ms colour fade, mono 11px label) is the source's geometry.
- **Workaround:** none for the dashes.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (dash length and phase).
- **Components it hits:** just this page.

## "3 axes": the strip, list and grid are the port's components

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (the components' own drift entries apply).
- **Original:** `Tabs` / `TabsList` / `TabItem`, an inline `Dropdown aria-label="Folders"` of `MenuItem`s, and a two-column `CardGroup` of clickable `Card`s (`demos.tsx:530-606`).
- **Port:** the same composition on `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/tabs.tsx`, `dropdown.tsx` and `card.tsx` (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/axes.tsx`). `Dropdown` has no `aria-label` prop, so the list has no accessible name; see `drift/tabs.md`, `drift/dropdown.md` and `drift/card.md` for how each component differs.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## "When to split a list": narrower canvas and a hand-built sidebar

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the 600px page column, `apps/demo/src/app.tsx:80`) and `not ported yet` (sidebar parts).
- **Original:** a 640 x 400 canvas, scrolled sideways when narrower, with a 260px framed `Sidebar` (`SidebarProvider`, `SidebarGroup`, `SidebarMenuSub`, `SidebarMenuSubButton href`, a `SidebarSeparator`, a disabled `SidebarMenuButton` at 50% opacity) and three callouts whose arrows are SVG `<marker>` paths measured against the real rows with a `MutationObserver` / `ResizeObserver` and a `Range` over the glyphs' line boxes (`demos.tsx:866-1246`).
- **Port:**
  - The frame's inner width is 598px, so the canvas is 598 wide and the sidebar sits 179px from the left (the source's 200 less 21), keeping the left labels, the arrows and the right label inside the frame (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/lists.tsx:42-50`).
  - The sidebar is a plain column of `SidebarContent`, `SidebarGroupLabel` and two `SidebarMenu` scopes; the sub rows are level-1 `SidebarMenuButton`s, not link buttons; the divider is a local 1px `color.border` box with 8px side margins; "Knowledge" is `disabled` (the hover skips it) inside a wrapper at 50% opacity, because `SidebarMenuButton`'s `disabled` hides a row from the hover without dimming it (`drift/sidebar.md`, "Disabled rows").
  - The arrows are a path with the source's `<marker>` chevron (`ArrowMarker`, `apps/demo/src/pages/surfaces/annotations.tsx`), as in the source. The target rows are measured through wrappers around them (`onLayout` plus a per-frame loop for 600 ms after the Chat row toggles, since the sub-menu's height springs), and the callout copy is the source's `text-balance` at `maxWidth: 140` (`demos.tsx:1198-1214`). A `<text>`'s box is as wide as greedy wrapping makes it, where the source reads the glyphs' line boxes through a `Range`; the port wraps the string in a `<span>`, whose rect ends where its longest line's glyphs do, and measures that.
  - The arrows stay hidden until the rows are painted, and stay where they were while the demo is culled.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this page; the sidebar drift is in `drift/sidebar.md`.

## "What it costs": three stats, not four, and not the same two measurements

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap` (no readable style writes; no `requestAnimationFrame`).
- **Original:** four stats: moves, pick per move, longest frame between two `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks, and layout writes, counted by a frame loop that diffs the highlight's inline `top` / `left` / `width` / `height` against its `transform` (`demos.tsx:608-863`). A top / left animation would write one every frame; the page's claim is that the highlight writes none.
- **Port:** three stats (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/cost.tsx`). "pick per move" times the port's own `pickNearest` on every move with the measured rects, as the source does (mean of the last 100). "longest frame" is the longest gap between two ticks of the shared 16 ms timer while the pointer is inside (a stalled tick over 100 ms is dropped by `apps/demo/src/lib/clock.ts`), so it shows a stall in the process, not a paint. "layout writes" is dropped: the port's highlight moves by `x` / `y` through gpuix's native `motion`, there is no inline style to watch, and no number would be an honest measurement. The sentence "1 element, 1 transform, 1 loop per move" is kept verbatim, and is true of the element and the loop only.
- **Workaround:** the stats sit in one row of three; the source's grid is two columns on a narrow viewport and four wide.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (two of three stats as in the source, the third a different measurement; one dropped).
- **Components it hits:** every fluid list's highlight (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/fluid-highlight.tsx`), which moves on layout properties.

## "Use when" / "Skip when" and the section rhythm

- **Cause:** `port choice`.
- **Original:** a `grid gap-6 pt-6 sm:grid-cols-2` of two lists with `list-disc pl-5 marker:text-muted-foreground` (`page.tsx:125-146`).
- **Port:** a two-column row at 24px gap; each bullet is a 5px circle in `mutedForeground` in a 24px gutter, the text beside it (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover.tsx:93-135`). The columns never stack, because the page column is a fixed 600px.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Each demo stage hides its content while far from the viewport

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap` (every element is laid out and painted even when a scroller clips it away: README "Missing features", culling row).
- **Original:** no such step; the browser skips what is off screen.
- **Port:** every `ComponentPreview` hides its content while more than 25% of a viewport from the page scroller and keeps the size it was last laid out at (`content-visibility: hidden`), through the shared `createCulling` (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/cull.ts:61-121`, used at `apps/demo/src/lib/doc-page.tsx:167`, `:485`), the same as `DemoCard`, the home tiles and every `DocSection`; the 200-row list is the reason. Culling is on for every `ComponentPreview`, not only this page's.
- **Workaround:** the above.
- **Fidelity:** exact once painted.
- **Components it hits:** every long page.

## Smaller differences

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** rows are `<button>`s with `focus-visible:ring-1`; the page text is Inter and the monospace is `font-mono` (`demos.tsx:131-162`). The axes demo's padding is `responsive` (compact on mobile).
- **Port:** rows are `buttonProps` divs with an outline offset of 0 on `focusVisible` (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/parts.tsx:42-124`), no-op click; the monospace is Menlo, which the browser resolves to `ui-monospace` (same in Chrome on macOS, not Safari). The Code tab shows the source's five snippets verbatim (`apps/demo/src/pages/fluid-hover/snippets.ts`) in plain Menlo without highlighting, so they describe the React hook, not the port's. The axes demo has the default padding only (the page column is a fixed 600px).
- **Fidelity:** exact except the monospace face.
