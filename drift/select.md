# select

Original: `registry/base/select.tsx` (shared: `registry/default/lib/popup.ts`, `hooks/use-keyboard-nav-gate.ts`, `fluid-hover-highlight.tsx`, `lib/size-context.tsx`), demo in `app/docs/select/page.tsx` of the source
(fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/select.tsx`, demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/select.tsx`.
Popup chrome is shared: `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/popup.tsx`, `src/lib/presence.ts`, `src/lib/list-nav.ts`.

## The first open of a popup that flips starts from the wrong side

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`.
- **Original:** the slide is `y: var(--popup-enter-y)`, set by the resolved `data-side` and read by Motion when the tween starts, after the positioner has landed (`registry/base/select.tsx:470-478`, `registry/default/lib/popup.ts:16-23`).
- **Port:** the popup enters on `y` ±4, `scaleY` .96 and opacity on `spring.fast`, about `top` or, once flipped, `bottom` (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/popup.tsx:43-44`, `:66-70`, `:78`). `initial` is read once, at mount, when the side is still the one asked for: a popup that then flips above its trigger starts that first open with the slide of the wrong side (its origin follows at once). From the second open the reported side is already known.
- **gpuix lacks:** `var()` in a Motion key (only the transform style properties substitute it, `docs/fork/paint-and-transforms.md:148`), and an `initial` that follows a signal.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (the first open of a flipped popup only, 4 px of travel at opacity 0 to 1 over 80 ms).
- **Components it hits:** combobox, dropdown.

## Form value is a real, invisible input

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`.
- **Original:** Base UI renders a hidden input, so `name` and `required` work in a `<form>` (`select.tsx:211-213`).
- **Port:** `FormValue` mounts only when `name` or `required` is set (`select.tsx:576-584`).
- **gpuix lacks:** `<input type="hidden">` (README, Missing features, `FormValue` row).
- **Workaround:** `FormValue` is an invisible, unreachable input; an empty required one hands focus to the trigger.
- **Fidelity:** exact.
- **Components it hits:** combobox, color-picker.

## Implicit submission needs a lone input

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap`.
- **Original:** Enter in a form control submits and an empty `required` select blocks it and takes focus.
- **Port:** only `form.requestSubmit()` validates; the demo calls it from the Submit button (`demos/select.tsx:286`).
- **gpuix lacks:** a submit button (`SubmitEvent.submitter` is always `null`), so a form with two or more `<input>`s does not submit on Enter (`ghia:docs/reference.md:4485-4492`): the demo's form holds the Name input and the Select's `FormValue` input. Enter in a lone empty `required` `<input>` does validate now (README Bugs row "select, combobox"; `drift/combobox.md`).
- **Workaround:** `requestSubmit()`.
- **Fidelity:** exact for `requestSubmit()`, dropped for implicit submission.
- **Components it hits:** combobox.

## Releasing the press outside the popup does not cancel

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** press the trigger, drag, release outside both trigger and popup: Base UI cancels (`SelectItem.tsx:194-236`, `SelectTrigger.tsx:27-129`, per `base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:546`).
- **Port:** rows judge the release (`select.tsx:339-347`); a release elsewhere leaves the popup open.
- **gpuix lacks:** n/a: a `window` listener hears every `mouseup`, whatever it lands on (`ghia:docs/reference.md:4758-4768`), so the cancel can be built; the port has not adopted one (`base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:546`).
- **Workaround:** none; the press-and-drag commit itself is ported (400 ms or 8px, `select.tsx:35-38`).
- **Fidelity:** dropped (the cancel).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Group labels are not a group

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `SelectGroup` renders `role="group"` around its label and rows (`select.tsx:768-778`).
- **Port:** labels and separators are flat entries in the same list; no group element or role (`select.tsx:434-463`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (looks the same; the a11y tree has no group).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Compact group label keeps the default size

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** `typeClass("caption", compact ? "compact" : "default")`, so 11/14 in compact with `py-1.5` (`select.tsx:785-792`, `type-scale.ts` caption).
- **Port:** a fixed 28px row and `scale.caption` (12/16) at every size (`select.tsx:97`, `:436-448`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (compact label is 2px taller and 1px larger text).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## An explicit `size` does not scope the parts inside

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (the port has no provider; the ambient size is the Size row, `sizeChoice()` in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/theme.ts`).
- **Original:** `size` wraps the select in a `SizeProvider` and `SelectTrigger` takes its own `size`, so trigger and popup follow together (`registry/base/select.tsx:99-102`, `:223`, `:278-281`).
- **Port:** `size?: "default" | "compact"` on `Select` only; omitted, it follows the Size row (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/select.tsx:95`, `:113`).
- **Workaround:** pass `size` to each nested component. `CommandMenuFilters` in the source wraps its children in `SizeProvider size="compact"` and forces `w-auto min-w-0` on every `[role=combobox]` (`command-menu.tsx:996-1021`); the port has neither, so each filter select passes `size="compact"` and `hug` (the `w-auto min-w-0`) itself.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** every component that reads `useSize`.

## Data-driven API and `null` for no value

- **Cause:** `port choice` (data-driven `items`, not compound, per `base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:504`; reason otherwise not stated).
- **Original:** compound `Select` / `SelectTrigger` / `SelectContent` / `SelectItem index` / `SelectGroup` / `SelectLabel` / `SelectSeparator`; `variant`, `icon`, `placeholder`, `error`, `size` on the trigger; value is a string, `""` for none; `className` and `ref` forwarded (`select.tsx:91-103`, `:254-263`, `:625-630`).
- **Port:** one `Select` taking `items` (items, `{ type: "label" }`, `{ type: "separator" }`), `variant`, `size`, `placeholder`, `icon`, `error`, `labelledBy`, `label` (the trigger's `aria-label`; the source passes it to `SelectTrigger` as a prop), `hug` (the trigger is as wide as its content, the source's `w-auto min-w-0` on the command menu's filters, which pass it as a `className`); value is `Value | null`; no `className` or `ref` (`select.tsx:111-135`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (API shape; row `index` is computed, not passed).
- **Components it hits:** combobox, dropdown.

## Default variant is `inline`, a port-only variant

- **Cause:** `port choice` (serves the app frame's theme picker, `app.tsx:452`, and the site's "Make them yours" card; docstring at `select.tsx:54-58`).
- **Original:** `variant` is `"bordered"` (default) or `"borderless"` (`select.tsx:241-249`).
- **Port:** `variant` defaults to `"inline"` (`select.tsx:136`): borderless, compact trigger, 13px text, shows the picked item's icon, popup right-aligned and content-sized like the others (`select.tsx:137-148`, `:396`). Every demo passes `bordered` explicitly.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** exact for `bordered` and `borderless` (an `error` draws the destructive border on both, as the source does).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## The port adds a pressed background on the trigger

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** only `hover:bg-hover`; no pressed style (`select.tsx:243-246`).
- **Port:** `active: { backgroundColor: color.active }` (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/select.tsx:325`).
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (extra state; the popup opens on mouse-down, so it shows briefly).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## The list scrolls in a bare scroller

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. Same drift as [dropdown.md, "Popup list scrolls in plain `overflow`, not ScrollArea"](dropdown.md#popup-list-scrolls-in-plain-overflow-not-scrollarea), where the entry lives. Here: original `select.tsx:538`; port `select.tsx:599-606` (`base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md:541`: gpuix has `scrollbarWidth: "none"`, `onScroll` offsets and `maskImage`).

## Clicks between rows are not routed to the lit row

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. Same drift as [dropdown.md, "Clicks in the padding and between rows are not routed to the lit row"](dropdown.md#clicks-in-the-padding-and-between-rows-are-not-routed-to-the-lit-row), where the entry lives. Here: original `select.tsx:505`; port `Row` handles its own click (`select.tsx:690`).

## The selected background fades in on every open

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`. Same drift as [dropdown.md, "Checked background appears with a fade instead of already being there"](dropdown.md#checked-background-appears-with-a-fade-instead-of-already-being-there), where the entry lives. Here: original `select.tsx:551-578`; port `select.tsx:618-625`. (Was recorded as `port choice`; the blocker is the shared `FluidHighlight`, which `motion`'s `initial={false}` could serve.)

## Demo: variants, copy and page shape

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated) for the copy and counts; `not ported yet` for the code snippets and API tables.
- **Original:** sections Basic, Variants (bordered + borderless, 3 fruits), With Icons, Groups, Scrollable List, Error State, Disabled; each has a code snippet, and the page ends with four props tables (`page.tsx:278-428`).
- **Port:** the same seven, as rows in cards (`demos/select.tsx:110-239`), plus three the source lacks: Compact, Uncontrolled (keyboard, typeahead and `defaultValue` selects), and a Form card with a required select. Differences: Variants and Basic use four fruits (Apple, Banana, Cherry, Mango) where the source's Variants has three (`:16-20`, `:122-137`); the disabled select holds Admin / Editor / Viewer, the source's one "Option A" (`:197-206`); "Some disabled" lists "Also available" where the source repeats "Available" (`:65-69`); Basic sets `variant="bordered"` explicitly. No code snippets, no props tables, no page description.
- **Workaround:** none.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** every demo page shares the card layout and lacks the snippets.
