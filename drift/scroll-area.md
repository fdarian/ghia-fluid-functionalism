# scroll-area

Original: `registry/base/scroll-area.tsx` plus the `scroll-fade` / `scroll-divider` utilities in `app/globals.css:1087-1236`, demo in `app/docs/scrollbars/page.tsx` of the source (fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`). Ported in `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx`, demo in `apps/demo/src/demos/scroll-area.tsx`.

The Base UI behaviour rows (thumb maths, hover / scrolling state, drag, track press, wheel) are tracked in `base-ui:BASE-UI-AUDIT.md` ("ScrollArea"); this file lists only what still looks or behaves differently.

## The edge fade is a mask, and masks are drawn on macOS only

- **Cause:** `gpuix gap` (README "Missing features": effect groups off macOS).
- **Original:** `.scroll-fade` / `.scroll-fade-x` are a CSS `mask-image` on the viewport whose end alphas follow a scroll timeline; browsers without scroll timelines (Firefox) get no fade (`app/globals.css:1087-1093`, `:1198-1235`).
- **Port:** `maskImage` on the viewport, a linear gradient rebuilt from the `onScroll` offset with the same ramps (alpha 1 at the true start / end, 0 once 48px lie past the edge, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx:83-113`, `:230`). The earlier overlay gradient in the surface colour is gone, so the content itself dissolves, as on the web.
- **gpuix lacks:** a mask on Windows and Linux. `maskImage` is an effect group (`ghia:docs/fork/paint-and-transforms.md:23`, `ghia:docs/fork/deviations.md:289`), built on macOS in zed's `gpui_apple`; the WGSL and HLSL paths are unproven. There a masked viewport paints without the fade.
- **Workaround:** none needed on macOS.
- **Fidelity:** exact on macOS (apart from `Math.min(fadeSize, length / 2)` at `:104`, which the CSS does not do for a viewport under 96px); no fade elsewhere. A new gradient string is built on every scroll event. A `both` area fades vertically only, as the single class does on the web.
- **Components it hits:** any `ScrollArea` with `fade`.

## Touch-primary devices keep the custom scrollbar

- **Cause:** `port choice` (desktop only: the audit notes gpuix has no touch input; `useTouchPrimary` is not ported).
- **Original:** on touch-primary devices the Base UI tree is replaced by a native-overflow `div` (`role="group"`, `aria-roledescription="scroll area"`, `tabIndex=0`) and `ScrollBar` renders nothing (`registry/base/scroll-area.tsx:49-75`, `:109-112`; `registry/default/hooks/use-touch-primary.tsx`).
- **Port:** one path, the drawn scrollbar (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx:140-283`).
- **Workaround:** n/a.
- **Fidelity:** dropped (no touch path).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Keyboard scrolling is re-implemented

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated). gpuix already scrolls the nearest scroller on arrows, Page, Home, End and Space unless `preventDefault`ed (`ghia:docs/fork/scroll.md:42`), so the handler duplicates a default.
- **Original:** the viewport is a tab stop while it overflows and the browser scrolls it with the keys (Base UI `Viewport:367-369`; FF sets no `tabIndex` of its own on the Base UI path, `registry/base/scroll-area.tsx:83-92`); keys typed in a descendant input or listbox do not scroll it.
- **Port:** `onKeyDown` on the viewport maps arrows (40px), Page keys and Space (87.5% of the view), Home and End to `scrollTo`, and calls `preventDefault` (`base-ui:src/scroll-area/root/use-scroll-area-root.ts:188-203`, `onKeyDown`). It acts only when the viewport itself is the focused element and the key is not already `defaultPrevented`, so an input inside keeps Space, arrows and Home / End, and a child that handles arrows itself does not also scroll the area (`apps/demo/scripts/check-scroll-area.tsx`).
- **Workaround:** n/a.
- **Fidelity:** exact for the keys it maps; the rest of gpuix's own defaults are unreachable because the handler `preventDefault`s the mapped keys.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Props: class names, `ref` and div props are gone

- **Cause:** `port choice` (no CSS classes in gpuix; `fade` and `divider` stand in for `scroll-fade` / `scroll-divider`).
- **Original:** `className`, `viewportClassName`, `ref`, any `<div>` prop, and a separately exported `ScrollBar` (`registry/base/scroll-area.tsx:29-33`, `:164`).
- **Port:** `width`, `height`, `style` (border and radius), `testId`, `fade`, `fadeSize`, `divider`; no `ref`, `aria-*` or `ScrollBar` export (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx:39-64`).
- **Workaround:** n/a.
- **Fidelity:** approximated (the fade is on only for the vertical axis, or the horizontal one of a horizontal area; the web picks per class).
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## The command menu does not use it

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** the command-menu list is a `ScrollArea` with `scroll-divider` and `scroll-fade`, its content forced back to a shrinkable block with `[&>div[style]]:!block [&>div[style]]:!min-w-0` (`registry/default/command-menu.tsx:1069-1138`).
- **Port:** a bare `overflowY: "scroll"` scroller (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/command-menu.tsx:967`), which has no sizing wrapper to override; the `divider` prop has no consumer there. The sidebar content does use `ScrollArea`, with `contentStyle` standing in for the source's `[&>div]:!block [&>div]:!min-w-0` (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/sidebar.tsx:648-655`).
- **Workaround:** gpuix's own overlay bar.
- **Fidelity:** dropped for the command menu.
- **Components it hits:** command-menu (see its drift file).

## Demo: "The problem" is static and smaller

- **Cause:** the script is `not ported yet` (the component has no way to be driven, below); the size and copy are `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** two 256 x 224 lists (`h-56 w-64`) with a scripted fake cursor that slides in, scrolls down and back and leaves, feeding pointer events to the `ScrollArea` (`app/docs/scrollbars/page.tsx:248-262`, `:262-370`). Captions: "The native scrollbar hides until you scroll, so the list looks cut off" and "ScrollArea shows its scrollbar on hover and fades the edges", each with a leading X / check mark (`:347-366`).
- **Port:** 256 x 168, no cursor script; captions "Plain overflow: nothing says there is more below" and "ScrollArea: scrollbar on hover, faded edges" (`apps/demo/src/demos/scroll-area.tsx:114-137`). The plain panel is `overflowY: "scroll"`, so it shows gpuix's overlay bar, not a hidden macOS one.
- **Why not in the demo:** `ScrollArea` takes its hover and scroll offset only from real pointer and wheel events: no `ref`, no hover prop, no controlled offset (`packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx:39-64`). A demo cannot feed it a scripted cursor the way the source dispatches `pointermove` and sets `scrollTop` (`page.tsx:283-309`), and a cursor drawn over the lists with the thumb left unshown would be fake.
- **Workaround:** none without a component change.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Demo: the horizontal strip needs an explicit height

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated; the viewport is `height: 100%` of the root, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/scroll-area.tsx:255`).
- **Original:** `className="w-full"`, no height; the strip is as tall as its tiles (80 + 24 padding, `app/docs/scrollbars/page.tsx:380-405`).
- **Port:** `height={104}` (`apps/demo/src/demos/scroll-area.tsx:144`). Tiles, gap, padding, radius and the faded edges match.
- **Workaround:** the caller passes the height.
- **Fidelity:** exact at that height; an auto-height area is not supported.
- **Components it hits:** just this one.

## Demo: variants added, and docs prose dropped

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the extra cards are test fixtures; reason for dropping the prose not stated).
- **Original:** sections The problem, The scrollbar, The fade, Examples (Horizontal, Double overflow), API reference, with code snippets and a PropsTable; no divider, rounded-clip or nested examples (`app/docs/scrollbars/page.tsx:492-580`).
- **Port:** the first, horizontal and both-axis cards, plus "Rounded clip" (28px radius, with and without the fade), "Scroll divider" and "Nested scroll areas" (`apps/demo/src/demos/scroll-area.tsx:214-270`). No prose, no snippets, no API table, no `R` shape toggle hint.
- **Workaround:** n/a.
- **Fidelity:** all source variants present (the standalone fade is the last card, 288 x 256 as `w-72 h-64`), except the cursor script (above).
- **Components it hits:** every demo.
