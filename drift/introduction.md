# introduction

Original: `app/docs/page.tsx` of the source (fluidfunctionalism.com at 0a0377e, kept at `~/.claude/notes/ff-source/`).
Ported in `apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx`, routed by the page registry (`apps/demo/src/lib/demo.ts` `loadPages`, `apps/demo/src/app.tsx` `PageBody`).

One entry per place the port looks or behaves differently from the source, whatever the cause. Shared gpuix gaps
(selector `:has(.x)` and group-has) get a one-line entry here that links to the README row instead of
repeating it.

## The previous / next arrows are missing

- **Cause:** `not ported yet`.
- **Original:** two ghost icon buttons with tooltips ("Showcase ←", "<first component> →") at the right of the header (`app/docs/page.tsx:35-53`).
- **Port:** none; the header is `App`'s heading and the page's subtitle.
- **Fidelity:** dropped.
- **Components it hits:** every docs page in the source has them (`lib/docs/DocPage.tsx`).

## The copy describes right-panel controls the port does not have

- **Cause:** `not ported yet` (Radius, Size and Icons rows); the Primitive row is not ported at all (Base UI only), so the Radix / Base UI sentence stays wrong.
- **Original:** "Customize using the right panel" lists light and dark, the corner radius, icon libraries, the Radix / Base UI install flavor, and "Press T, R, or I to flip the first three from the keyboard" (`app/docs/page.tsx:125-135`).
- **Port:** the text is verbatim (`apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx:47`). The right column has only the Theme select, and no T / R / I shortcuts exist.
- **Fidelity:** exact text, describes more than the port offers.

## The heading sits 8px above the subtitle only by a negative margin

- **Cause:** `port choice`.
- **Original:** `h1` `text-site-display leading-none mb-2` at `fontWeights.bold` (`app/docs/page.tsx:23-30`): a 28px line, 8px above the subtitle.
- **Port:** `App`'s shared `Heading` (`apps/demo/src/app.tsx:83-96`) is bold with a 34px line and sits a 24px column gap above the page, which the subtitle cancels with `marginTop: -16` (`apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx:217`), so the gap reads 8px past the taller line box.
- **Workaround:** the negative margin.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
- **Components it hits:** every page and demo heading (34px line).

## Section titles use a 16px line

- **Cause:** `port choice` (to match `leading-none`).
- **Original:** `h2` / `h3` `text-site-title leading-none`, semibold 550 (`app/docs/page.tsx:60,139-145`): a 16px line.
- **Port:** `scale.title` with `lineHeight: 16` and `weight.semibold` (`apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx:60-73`).
- **Fidelity:** exact.

## The code block overflows the 600px column and scrolls

- **Cause:** `port choice` (the page column width, `apps/demo/src/app.tsx:80`).
- **Original:** `<pre class="text-site-caption bg-muted/60 rounded-lg px-4 py-3 overflow-x-auto w-fit max-w-full">` (`app/docs/page.tsx:186`), in the source's own column. Its width was not measured.
- **Port:** the same box with `overflowX: "scroll"` (`apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx:170-210`). The longest line is 80 characters of 12px Menlo, about 578px, plus 32px of padding, so it overflows the 600px column by about 10px: the last characters of the `IconProvider` line need a scroll, and gpuix draws the scrollbar. No syntax highlighting, as in the source.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.

## Smaller differences

- **Cause:** `port choice` (reason not stated).
- **Original:** `hr` `border-border/60` (`app/docs/page.tsx:138,160,171`), the numbered badges `bg-muted` (`:148,155`), `font-mono` for the code (`:187`).
- **Port:** the rules use `color.borderFaint` (`rgba(…,0.072)`, exactly 60% of `border`, `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/theme.ts:107,155`) and the code block `withAlpha(muted, 0.6)`. The code face is Menlo like `InputCopy`'s (`apps/demo/src/pages/introduction.tsx:19`), where the browser resolves `font-mono` to `ui-monospace`.
- **Fidelity:** exact except the monospace face (same in Chrome on macOS, not in Safari).

## The page-level `px-6`

- **Cause:** `port choice`.
- **Original:** the page content has `px-6` (`app/docs/page.tsx:20`).
- **Port:** the 600px column replaces the padding.
- **Fidelity:** approximated.
