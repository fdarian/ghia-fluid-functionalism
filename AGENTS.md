Solid app that draws the [Fluid Functionalism](https://fluidfunctionalism.com) component library on [gpuix](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix), a GPUI-backed renderer with no DOM and no CSS engine: every component, demo and page of the source site, with its fluid hover, springs and keyboard behaviour. It is a port, so most work is closing or recording a difference from the source. [README.md](README.md) is the overview (run it, add a component, the gpuix gaps and bugs, the drift table); [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) says which upstream commit each file tracks and how to sync.

## Stack
- Solid JSX on `@ghia/solid` and `@ghia/native` from npm (source and docs: [fdarian/ghia](https://github.com/fdarian/ghia); `docs/reference.md` is the API, `docs/fork/` says where it differs from the DOM; refs into them read `ghia:docs/<path>:lines`, read at `730f77f1`). Elements are gpuix's (`<div>`, `<text>`, `<anchored>`, `motion.*`) with style objects, not HTML and CSS classes.
- Bun runs everything, with the Solid transform and the demo/page/changelog registry as preloads (`apps/demo/bunfig.toml`): no build step to develop. `pnpm build` compiles one binary. pnpm 12 installs. TypeScript 7 (`tsc`), Biome (tabs, single quotes), path alias `#/*` -> `src/*`.
- Behaviour primitives (keys, selection, open state, focus, ARIA) come from `ghia-base-ui` on npm (source: [fdarian/ghia-base-ui](https://github.com/fdarian/ghia-base-ui); `base-ui:` paths are in that repo). This repo keeps styling, springs and fluid hover.

## Folders
- `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/` — the ported components, styled with tokens from `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/theme.ts`. Each consumes its base-ui primitive where Base UI has one.
- `apps/demo/src/demos/` — one file per component page (`title`, `group`, `Demo`, optional `scenarios` for screenshots); `apps/demo/src/lib/demo.ts` reads them through the `virtual:demos` module.
- `apps/demo/src/pages/`, `apps/demo/src/home/` — the site's own pages (Introduction, Changelog, the System pages, Compare, Concepts, Audio Mixer) and the home bento grid; `apps/demo/src/app.tsx` is the shell and sidebar, `apps/demo/src/main.tsx` the entry.
- `src/lib/` — shared code: `theme.ts` (tokens, springs, shadows), `fluid-hover.ts` / `fluid-highlight.tsx`, `focus-ring.tsx`, `popup.tsx`, `demo-kit.tsx`, `doc-page.tsx`, icons. The table is in README under "Shared code".
- `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/cli.ts` — the npx shim, the only code the npm package ships (`dist/cli.js`): downloads, verifies and runs the darwin-arm64 binary from the GitHub Release. It imports nothing from the app.
- `apps/demo/scripts/` — `check-*.tsx` scenario checks (each runnable alone with `bun apps/demo/scripts/check-x.tsx`), `check-kit.tsx` (their harness), `screenshots.tsx`, the two runners.
- `drift/` — one markdown file per component or page listing every place the port differs from the source, with a Cause. [`drift/_TEMPLATE.md`](drift/_TEMPLATE.md) is the shape; README's table counts the entries.
- `apps/demo/screenshots/`, `apps/demo/content/changelog/`, `apps/demo/assets/` — captures per page, the verbatim upstream changelog, fonts and images.

## Commands
- `pnpm install` — from this directory only. `pnpm start` runs the app; `pnpm check:type` is `tsc`.
- `pnpm check:scenarios` takes about 30 minutes, so run `bun apps/demo/scripts/check-<component>.tsx` for the component you touched and `pnpm check` before merging.
- `pnpm screenshots [slug]` — one page, or about 25 minutes for all of them.
- `pnpm perf [slug...] --label x` — live frame times on the real window into `apps/demo/perf/<label>.json` (README, "Harness and shared-lib notes"); results are not committed.
- `pnpm footprint [slug...] --label x` — idle CPU and memory per page in a fresh compiled child, headless; `--window` for a real window, `--tour` for what a session leaves behind (README, "Harness and shared-lib notes"); results land in `apps/demo/perf/`.
- `pnpm build` — `dist/fluid-functionalism` (Bun compile) and `bundle/Fluid Functionalism.app`; needs `cargo install cargo-packager --locked` (README, "Build the app").
- `pnpm format` — Biome.
- `pnpm changeset` — describe a change; merging the Version Packages PR runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. `ci:release` (`bun apps/demo/scripts/release-binary.ts`, then `changeset publish`) writes `dist/cli.js`, `dist/checksums.json` and `dist/releases/*.tar.gz`; run it only in CI. `ci.yml` runs `apps/demo/scripts/check-single-instance.ts`.

## Rules
- `@ghia/solid`, `@ghia/native` and `ghia-base-ui` are pinned to exact versions in `package.json`. `ghia-base-ui` peer-depends on `@ghia/solid` and `solid-js`; a second copy of either gives two renderers or reactive graphs and silent breakage. `apps/demo/scripts/check-single-instance.ts` catches it.
- A behaviour change (keys, selection, ARIA, open state, typeahead, presence) goes into the primitive in `ghia-base-ui`, not into a component here (release it, then bump the pin). A look change (tokens, motion, fluid hover) stays here. Its `BASE-UI-AUDIT.md` (in the repo, not the npm package) records where the primitives differ from Base UI.
- A component adds `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/components/<name>.tsx`, `apps/demo/src/demos/<name>.tsx` and `drift/<name>.md` and edits no shared file. Whenever code the drift file cites moves, its `file:line` refs move with it; refs into the primitives read `base-ui:src/<path>:lines`.
- gpuix cannot do some things the source does (selector `:has(.x)` and group-has, `var()` in a Motion key, a `layoutId` crossfade). Record the approximation in the drift file and link the README gap row; do not paper over it.
- Screenshot diffs are noisy: playground variants use `Math.random`, and the caret and timing demos vary run to run. Compare the content area by pixels, not hashes, and do not recommit `apps/demo/screenshots/` for noise.
- The compiled binary reads nothing from the repo. A runtime asset is an embedded import (`with { type: 'file' }`); an image `src` goes through `diskPath` in `apps/demo/src/lib/assets.ts`, because gpuix's Rust loader cannot read `$bunfs`. Never build a path from `import.meta.url` or `import.meta.dir`, or scan a directory at runtime. Demos, pages and the changelog are found through the `virtual:*` modules of `apps/demo/scripts/registry-plugin.ts`, so a new demo still just adds its file.
- Source filenames are kebab-case; `src/` imports across directories use `#/`.

## Notes
Open on demand; each says what it covers first.
- [Product and owner decisions](./.agents/notes/product.md) — what question the port answers, the four standing decisions from 2026-10-16, what is deliberately not shipped (icons, sample photo); read before reopening scope
- [Motion and fluid hover](./.agents/notes/motion-and-fluid-hover.md) — springs, exits, native hover, press-shrink, the fluid-hover rules (integer rows, container-pixel reads, batched reads), native animation loops; read before touching `packages/fluid-functionalism/src/lib/fluid-hover.ts` or a component's motion
- [Transforms and layout glides](./.agents/notes/transforms-and-layout-glides.md) — where the source's transforms are used, the traps (measurements under a transform, glides only at a commit, `Unsteady` layout boxes), remaining approximations
- [Fonts and theme](./.agents/notes/fonts-and-theme.md) — variable-font weight tokens, why `StableLabel` keeps two ghosts, the theme cross-fade layer
- [Performance](./.agents/notes/performance.md) — culling, scroll-write and page-switch decisions, and the protocols that make `pnpm perf` / `pnpm footprint` / check budgets trustworthy
- [Verification](./.agents/notes/verification.md) — check and screenshot traps (still bounds, fractional content, noisy captures)
- [Tooling and build](./.agents/notes/tooling-and-build.md) — compile flags, registry plugin, drift causes, why `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and Biome a11y are off
- [Base UI seam](./.agents/notes/base-ui-seam.md) — controllable highlight, refs, `tabIndex` mechanics when moving behaviour between a component and a `ghia-base-ui` primitive
